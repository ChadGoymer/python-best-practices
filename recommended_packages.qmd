## Data Wrangling

While [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is the most popular package for data
wrangling, and may be used, it is recommended to use [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/)
instead. Polars is more performant and has more readable syntax.

## Charts

For static charts it is recommended to use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).
However, for interactive charts it is recommended to use
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) instead.

## Web Applications
When building dashboards or web applications, it is recommended to use
[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/). Shiny provides a simple to use framework, allowing
the developer to concentrate on the content and controls.
