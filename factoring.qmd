title: "Factoring"
---

As in mathematics, factoring refers to the process of breaking code up into smaller parts.
Complex code is much easier to understand, maintain and test if it is created from smaller
building blocks. Much like a book is divided into chapters, sections, paragraphs, Python
code should be divided into modules, functions, classes and methods.

When deciding how to divide up code a useful rule-of-thumb is to describe what the code is
doing as bullet points. Each bullet point could then be a function or method. If a
function/method is still complex you may want to divide it further in to smaller
functions. Keep going until each function is doing one thing, and one thing only.

Another rule-of-thumb is if you find yourself repeating a chunk of code more than twice,
then make it a function, and call it instead. This means any future changes can be made in
one place, rather than many.
