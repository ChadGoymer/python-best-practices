## Style Guide

The official Python style guide is known as [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). In
Lloyd's, code should follow the PEP 8 style, as described. For a more accessible overview,
read the article [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP
8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).

### Automated Styling

To simplify the process of adhering to the PEP 8 conventions, we recomend using
[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to style your code. Ruff checks your code and gives
guidance on how to fix any issues (also known as linting). It can be run from the command
line or as a [Visual Studio Code
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff). The
extension can also be used to format your code and it is recommended to set the option to
format on save, to keep your code tidy. This can be achieved by adding the following
options to your `settings.json` file:

``` json
"[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": "explicit",
        "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    }
}
```

## Naming Conventions

To ensure that code is written consistenty across projects, use the following naming
conventions.

| Type | Naming Convention | Examples |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| Variable | Use a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. | `x`, `var`, `python_variable` |
| Function | Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to improve readability. | `function`, `python_function` |
| Class | Start each word with a capital letter. Don’t separate words with underscores. This style is called camel case or Pascal case. | `Model`, `PythonClass` |
| Method | Use a lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. | `class_method`, `method` |
| Constant | Use an uppercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. | `CONSTANT`, `PYTHON_CONSTANT`, `PYTHON_LONG_CONSTANT` |
| Module | Use a short, lowercase word or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. | `module.py`, `python_module.py` |
| Package | Use a short, lowercase word or words. Don’t separate words with underscores. | `package`, `pythonpackage` |

### Use Meaningful Names

Don’t use vague or one-letter names (like `x` or `y`) if it is not for simple and short
loops. Instead, give names that explain what the variable or the function does. This makes
code much easier to read and understand.

**Bad Example:**

``` python
def a(x, y):
    return x + y
```

**Good Example:**

``` python
def add_numbers(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number + second_number
```

## Code Layout

### Blank Lines

-   Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines.
-   Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line.
-   Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps.

``` python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

### Indentation

-   Use four spaces to indent code.

``` python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
```

-   For long lines, we recommend using a hanging indent and put closing brackets on a new
    line, for example:

``` python
def function(
    arg_one,
    arg_two,
    arg_three,
    arg_four
):
    list_of_numbers = [
        arg_one,
        arg_two,
        arg_three,
        arg_four
    ]

    return list_of_numbers
```

### Line Length

-   Limit line length to 80 characters: Keep your code readable by not writing overly long
    lines. If a line gets too long, break it into smaller parts using parentheses or
    backslashes.

### Comments

-   Comments should be used sparingly. Using good names and clear layout should be enough
    in most cases. Comments should focus on why the code is written in a certain way, not
    what the code does.
-   For complicated code, split it into functions, classes and methods and use
    [docstrings](../documentation/index.qmd) to document them instead.

### Whitespace

-   Surround binary operators with a space.
-   Add a space after a comma
-   Do not use spaces around `=` when assigning function and method arguments
-   Do not leave spaces at the end of the line. Visual Studio Code has an option to remove
    trailing whitespace on save:

``` json
"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
```

## Coding Practices

### Avoid Hardcoding Values

Hardcoding values (e.g., numbers or strings) directly into your code can make it difficult
to update or reuse. Instead, use variables or constants.

**Bad Example:**

``` python
print("The total price with tax is: $105")  # Hardcoded tax and total price
```

**Good Example:**

``` python
PRICE = 100  # Base price of the product
TAX_RATE = 0.05  # 5% tax rate

# Calculate the total price
total_price = PRICE + (PRICE * TAX_RATE)

print(f"The total price with tax is: ${total_price:.2f}")
```

This makes your code more flexible and easy to modify.

### Avoid Global Variables

Relying on global variables can make your code harder to understand and debug. Instead,
encapsulate state within classes or functions.

**Bad Example (using a global variable):**

``` python
total = 0

def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total += value
```

**Good Example (using a class):**

``` python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total = 0

    def add_value(self, value):
        self.total += value
```

Encapsulating data within objects or functions ensures that your code is modular,
testable, and less error-prone.

### Use f-Strings for String Formatting

f-Strings (introduced in Python 3.6) are a clean and readable way to format strings.

**Bad Example (concatenating strings):**

``` python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old")
```

**Good Example (using f-strings):**

``` python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")
```

f-Strings are not only more readable but also more efficient than other string formatting
methods.

### Use Built-in Functions and Libraries

Python comes with many powerful built-in features. Use these to write efficient and proper
code instead of coding it from scratch.

**Bad Example (manually finding the maximum):**

``` python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_number = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_number:
            max_number = num
    return max_number
```

**Good Example (using max):**

``` python
def find_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)
```

### Use Pythonic Code

"Pythonic" code refers to writing code that takes advantage of Python’s simplicity and
readability. Avoid overly complex or verbose solutions when simpler options are available.

**Bad Example:**

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = []
for num in numbers:
    doubled.append(num * 2)
```

**Good Example:**

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers]
```

Using list comprehensions, built-in functions, and readable idioms makes your code more
elegant.

### Handle Errors Gracefully

As a beginner, it’s tempting to skip error handling, but it’s an important part of writing
good code. Use try and except blocks to handle potential errors.

``` python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"The number is {number}")
except ValueError:
    print("That’s not a valid number!")
```

This ensures your program doesn’t crash unexpectedly.
