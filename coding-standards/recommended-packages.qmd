## Data Wrangling

While [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is the most popular package for data
wrangling in Python, and may be used, it is recommended to use
[Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/) instead. Polars is more performant and has more readable
syntax. It is built to chain methods in an elegant way, for example:

``` python
import polars as pl

df = (
    pl.read_csv("docs/assets/data/iris.csv")
    .filter(pl.col("sepal_length") > 5)
    .group_by("species")
    .agg(pl.all().sum())
)
```

## Reading and Writing data

Polars has a number of methods for reading from and writing to common formats. Some of
them depend on other packages:

### CSV

Polars can read and write to CSV out of the box, using:

``` python
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_csv("data.csv")
df.write_csv("data.csv")
```

### Excel

Polars can read data from Excel by installing the
[fastexcel](https://fastexcel.toucantoco.dev/fastexcel.html) package and write using the
[xlsxwriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) package. Once installed, you can use:

``` python
df = pl.read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
df.write_excel("data.xlsx", worksheet="Sheet2")
```

### Databases

Polars can read and write to a database, if an appropriate connection is supplied. See
[lloydsdb](https://github/pages/mrc/lloyds-databases) for more details.

``` python
import polars as pl
import lloydsdb as db

engine = db.create_engine("Reserving_data")
df = pl.read_database("SELECT * FROM OldTable", connection=engine)
df.write_database("NewTable",  connection=engine)
```

## Visualisation

For visualisation, it is recommended to use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/). For
example:

``` python
import plotly.express as px

tips = px.data.tips()
px.scatter(tips, x="total_bill", y="tip")
```

## Reporting

When it comes to producing reports, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) provides a simple,
versatile and beautiful approach. It can be used to produce:

1.  Articles
2.  Presentations
3.  Books
4.  Websites
5.  Dashboards

## Web Applications

When building dashboards or web applications, it is recommended to use
[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/py/). Shiny provides a simple to use framework, allowing
the developer to concentrate on the content and controls. For example, a basic app can be
created using:

``` python
from shiny import App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fixed(
    ui.h1("Simple App"),
    ui.input_text("name", "Enter your name"),
    ui.output_text("greeting"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def greeting():
        return f"Hello {input.name()}, welcome to shiny!."


app = App(app_ui, server)
```
