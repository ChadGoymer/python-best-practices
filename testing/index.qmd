## Low Criticality

For low criticality projects, the tests should be run each time the project is used.

::::: {.grid}

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-note}
### [Manual Tests](manual-tests.qmd)
For low criticality projects, manual testing is sufficient. This involves running the code
and checking the results.
:::

::::

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-note}
### [Document Test Process](document-test-process.qmd)
The test process should be documented so that others can repeat the tests. The
documentation should be stored with the project.
:::

## Medium Criticality

For medium criticality projects, the tests should be run each time the code is changed.

::::: {.grid}

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-warning}
### [Coded Tests](coded-tests.qmd)
Tests should be written in code and stored with the project. This ensures the tests are
repeatable by others.
:::

::::

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-warning}
### [Test Reports](test-reports.qmd)
The tests results should be captured in a report for future reference.
:::

## High Criticality

For high criticality projects, the tests should be automated.

::::: {.grid}

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-important}
## [Test Coverage](test-coverage.qmd)
Test coverage should be monitored to ensure all code is tested. A suitable threshold
should be set.
:::

::::

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-important}
## [Validate Inputs](validate-inputs.qmd)
Validating the inputs ensures errors are captured early and produce a user-friendly
message.
