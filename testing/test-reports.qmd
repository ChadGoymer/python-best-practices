title: Test Reports
---

Test reports are invaluable for future reference. They provide a record of what was
tested, how it was tested, and the results of the tests. Creating test reports with
`pytest` requires a plugin called
[`pytest-html`](https://pytest-html.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[`pytest-html`](https://pytest-html.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be installed using
[uv](../reproducibility/project-management/uv.qmd). As with `pytest`, we use the "dev"
group so it is not an explicit dependency of the project.

``` powershell
uv add --dev pytest-html
```

## Generating Test Reports

Once installed, you can generate a test report by running `pytest` with the `--html`
argument, set to the name of the report file. For example:

``` powershell
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

Adding the `--self-contained-html` argument ensures that the report is created as a single
file, making it easier to move and share.

### Using Visual Studio Code

You can also configure Visual Studio Code to run tests and generate reports. This is done
by adding configuration settings to the `.vscode/settings.json` file. For example:

``` json
{
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "--html=report.html",
        "--self-contained-html",
        "tests"
    ]
}
```

Then whenever you run tests in Visual Studio Code, a new report will be generated.

## Viewing Test Reports

The report can be opened in your browser. The standard report looks like:

## Enhancing Reports

### Report Title

By default the report title will be the filename of the report, you can edit it by using
the `pytest_html_report_title` hook in the `conftest.py` file:

``` python
def pytest_html_report_title(report):
    report.title = "Testing Calculations"
```

### Enhancing the Results Table

The results table itself can also be modified. For details, please refer to the
[`pytest-html`](https://pytest-html.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation, however the
useful example below adds a 'Time' and 'Description' column to the table. The
'Description' is pulled from the docstring of the test function.

``` python
from datetime import datetime

import pytest


def pytest_html_results_table_header(cells):
    cells.insert(2, "<th>Description</th>")
    cells.insert(1, '<th class="sortable time" data-column-type="time">Time</th>')


def pytest_html_results_table_row(report, cells):
    cells.insert(2, f"<td>{report.description}</td>")
    cells.insert(
        1, f'<td class="col-time">{datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}</td>'
    )


@pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    outcome = yield
    report = outcome.get_result()
    report.description = str(item.function.__doc__)
```

This produces the following output:
