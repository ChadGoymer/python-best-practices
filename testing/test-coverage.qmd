title: Test Coverage
---

Test coverage is an important metric for indicating how much of your code is being tested.
When the tests are run, each line executed is tracked and the coverage is the percentage
of lines executed, compared to the total number of lines of code. The coverage should be
above 90%.

::: callout-note
Test coverage is not perfect, just a useful metric. Just because your coverage is 100%, it
does not mean every possible scenario is tested. For example, it may not capture edge
cases, such as when values are missing or 0.
:::

To calculate test coverage with `pytest`, install the
[`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) plugin using
[uv](../reproducibility/project-management/uv.qmd). As with `pytest`, we use the "dev"
group so it is not an explicit dependency of the project.

``` powershell
uv add --dev pytest-cov
```

## Calculating Test Coverage

Once installed, you can calculate test coverage by running `pytest` with the `--cov`
argument set to the name of the code directory. For example:

``` powershell
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Adding the `--cov-report=term-missing` argument highlights the lines of code that are not
being executed during the tests. This is very useful to identify the tests that should be
added to improve coverage.

### Using Visual Studio Code

You can also configure Visual Studio Code to run tests and calculate coverage. This is
done by adding configuration settings to the `.vscode/settings.json` file. For example:

``` json
{
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "--cov=src",
        "--cov-report=term-missing",
        "tests"
    ]
}
```

Then whenever you run tests in Visual Studio Code, the coverage will be calculated.

## Test Coverage Reports

The coverage report is printed to the terminal by default. It enhances the standard
`pytest` report:

![pytest-cov example](/images/pytest_coverage_example.png){width="600"}

`pytest-cov` also supports the generation of HTML reports using the `--cov-report`
argument. It is possible to specify multiple coverage reports, by repeatng the argument.
In order to combine the test reports, we can update the summary in the test report with a
link to the coverage report. For example, to run both reports, update the vscode settings
to output both reports to a `test_report` directory:

``` json
// /.vscode/settings.json
{
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "--cov=src",
        "--cov-report=term-missing",
        "--cov-report=html:test_report/coverage",
        "--html=test_report/index.html",
        "tests"
    ]
}
```

Then add a link to the coverage report, by adding a `pytest_html_results_summary` hook in
the test configuration file:

``` python
# /tests/conftest.py
from datetime import datetime

import pytest


def pytest_html_report_title(report):
    report.title = "Testing Calculations"


def pytest_html_results_summary(prefix, summary, postfix):
    prefix.extend(['<a href="coverage/index.html">Coverage Report</a>'])


def pytest_html_results_table_header(cells):
    cells.insert(2, "<th>Description</th>")
    cells.insert(1, '<th class="sortable time" data-column-type="time">Time</th>')


def pytest_html_results_table_row(report, cells):
    cells.insert(2, f"<td>{report.description}</td>")
    cells.insert(
        1, f'<td class="col-time">{datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}</td>'
    )


@pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    outcome = yield
    report = outcome.get_result()
    report.description = str(item.function.__doc__)
```

This produces the following report:

When you click on the **Coverage Report** link, it takes you to the main coverage report
page:

![pytest-cov main report page](/images/pytest_coverage_index.png)

Selecting a py file, shows more details, including the lines that have not been executed
when running the tests:
