### [Markdown](markdown.qmd)
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's designed
to be easy to read and write, converting plain text into rich text formats like HTML. Its
simplicity has made it popular for writing documentation and creating content for
websites.

### [README](readme.qmd)
A README file is the first thing someone looking at your code reads. It should contain a
summary of the project and instructions for how to use it. The README should be clear and
concise, and link to further documentation if more detail is required.

### [Docstrings](docstrings.qmd)
It is good practice to document code as it is being developed. If code is well-structured
into functions, classes and methods then each one should be documented separately. This
makes using them clear to developers. the standard approach for this are docstrings.

### [Process Scripts](process-scripts.qmd)
When running complex processes, it is a good idea to have one or more scripts to run.
These scripts, provide a simple high-level interface for users to set parameters and
run each step of the process, without requiring much knowledge of Python or the project.

## [Projects](projects.qmd)
All the documentation described exists within the project's code. This encourages
developers to update documentation as they change code. However, it is not very user
friendly. For critical projects, a website should be created collating all the
documentation.

## [Change Log](changelog.qmd)
As development occurs and changes are made, they should be tracked in GitHub. However,
extracting a summary of changes from a commit history is not easy. A Changelog provides a
brief summary of changes for each ask.
